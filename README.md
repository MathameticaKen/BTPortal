# BTPortal Customization

This HTML code can be copied directly into a new public HTML template.

The files in the folder have to be uploaded also to the file storage to the appliance.

You'll likely have to change a few things like the photo(Line 564), the Text(565,576) and colors(RGB colors in Line 120-123).

The "Content_area" box color has to be changed in the CSS file(Line 316).

My recommendation is to just download the files and run the HTML locally first.
